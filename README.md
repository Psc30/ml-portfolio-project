# üåå Exoplanet Classification Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I used a real-world dataset of confirmed exoplanets to build a classification model that predicts the **type of exoplanet** based on planetary and stellar attributes such as mass, radius, orbital characteristics, and distance from Earth. 

After performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), I began preparing the data for building classification models. The goal of this project is to identify which physical features are most influential in the classification task, offering insights into the diversity of planets beyond our solar system.

## Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model using real-world data.

## Project Steps
- [x] Data exploration and cleaning
- [ ] Feature selection/engineering
- [ ] Model selection and training
- [ ] Model evaluation
- [ ] Results and conclusion

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìä Dataset
The dataset comes from a publicly available exoplanet catalog and contains physical and orbital properties of exoplanets. Each row represents one exoplanet.

| Feature Name        | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`              | Name of the exoplanet by NASA                                      |
| `distance`          | Distance from Earth (in light years)                               |
| `stellar_magnitude` | Brightness of the host star                                        |
| `planet_type`       | Type of planet (e.g., Gas Giant) **‚Üê target variable**             |
| `discovery_year`    | Year the planet was discovered                                     |
| `mass_multiplier`   | Mass of the planet relative to Jupiter                             |
| `mass_wrt`          | Reference unit for mass (always "Jupiter")                         |
| `radius_multiplier` | Radius of the planet relative to Jupiter                           |
| `radius_wrt`        | Reference unit for radius (always "Jupiter")                       |
| `orbital_radius`    | Distance of planet from its star (in AU)                           |
| `orbital_period`    | Time it takes the planet to complete one orbit (in years)          |
| `eccentricity`      | Eccentricity of the orbit (0 = circular, closer to 1 = elliptical) |
| `detection_method`  | Detection method (e.g., Radial Velocity)                           |

## üßº Data Cleaning
- Dropped constant columns: mass_wrt, radius_wrt
- Handled missing values using median imputation for numerical columns
- Removed duplicate records
- Encoded categorical variables (planet_type, detection_method) using one-hot encoding

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed class distribution of planet types
- Visualized feature distributions
- Generated correlation heatmaps
- Explored relationships between mass, radius, orbital features, and planet type

## üîú Next Steps
- Perform feature selection and engineering
- Train and evaluate classification models
- Summarize key findings, insights, and feature importances
- Update this README with final conclusions and model performance once the project is complete
